* Phenology GUI
This GUI is for displaying images and selecting region of interest (ROI).
** requirement
Python 3 and a few external modules (install them with pip install
<module> if Python complains).

** Instruction
1. Place utils.py and session.py in the same directory and run session.py.

2. You have the option to load an output csv file from previous session or start a new session.
   - The output file from previous session should not have been altered! Work with copies if altering the file is necessary
   - If starting a new session, select all image files by using Ctrl or Shift buttons.

3. Marking ROI
   - Select ROI using the radio option. 
   - Create a polygon on the image.
     - Left click adds a point
     - Right click finalizes the polygon
   - Repeat above steps. You can reset the ROIs with "Clear ROI" button.
   - When you're done with the image, click "Finalize Image". This
     will save the ROI for the next image ("Apply Previous ROI" button).

4. Output
   - Click "Save and close" to save the output csv file.
   - The output will be a csv file with the iamge metadata, ROI coordinates, and ROI statistics
     - Note: ROI coordinates will be a list of (x,y) values
       - i.e. [(3,4), (10, 10), (5,2)]
   - This is the file you can load a session with. 

** Notes
*** Modifying ROI types
To modify the ROI types, you can edit the ROI_TYPES and ROI_COLORS variables in utils.py.
*** Modifying the ROI statistics
This is more complicated. You have to modify the STATS variable in
utils.py, but the output file save the result. I need to test this.

** Issues
*** ISSUE I need access to the NAS for the actual data
*** ISSUE Need code for extracting Camera_id and Date from the image
On the random test images I gathered, Aditye's code using exifread
doesn't work.  If you want to play with it, you can write the code in
utils.py. Search for TODO and replace None with your code.
*** TODO Create a button to save without closing
*** TODO Test modifying ROI statistics
