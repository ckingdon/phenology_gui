* Phenology GUI
This GUI is for displaying images and selecting region of interest (ROI).
** requirement
Python 3 and a few external modules (install them with pip install
<module> if Python complains).

** Instruction
1. Place utils.py and session.py in the same directory and run session.py.

2. You have the option to load an output csv file from previous session or start a new session.
   - The output file from previous session should not have been altered! Work with copies if altering the file is necessary
   - If starting a new session, select all image files by using Ctrl or Shift buttons.

3. Marking ROI
   - Select ROI using the radio option. 
   - Create a polygon on the image.
     - Left click adds a point
     - Right click finalizes the polygon
   - Repeat above steps. You can reset the ROIs with "Clear ROI" button.
   - When you're done with the image, click "Finalize Image". This
     will save the ROI for the next image ("Apply Previous ROI" button).

4. Output
   - Click "Save and close" to save the output csv file.
   - The output will be a csv file with the iamge metadata, ROI coordinates, and ROI statistics
     - Note: ROI coordinates will be a list of (x,y) values
       - i.e. [(3,4), (10, 10), (5,2)]
   - This is the file you can load a session with. 

5. Hotkeys
   - Enter: finalize image
   - Space: apply previous ROI
   - Right arrow: skip to next image
** Notes
*** Modifying ROI types
To modify the ROI types, you can edit the ROI_TYPES and ROI_COLORS variables in utils.py.
*** Modifying the ROI statistics
This is more complicated. You have to modify the STATS variable in
utils.py, but the output file save the result. I need to test this.

*** Modifying image canvas size
This might be useful if a large image is causing issues with the size
of your app. You can change the size of region dedicated for
displaying the image (default is 1600x1200). This is in utils.py under
CANVAS_SIZE variable.
** Issues
*** DONE Get Camera_id and image Date
    CLOSED: [2017-04-05 Wed 17:50]
**** RESOLVED Camera_ID
     CLOSED: [2017-04-06 Thu 13:33]
Assume that the input directory is the camera_id.
*** DONE RGB for entire image
    CLOSED: [2017-04-06 Thu 17:42]
*** DONE IO - single input and output per camera
    CLOSED: [2017-04-06 Thu 00:51]
The input will be a folder associated with a camera.
**** DONE Read all of .jpg files in the subdirectories
     CLOSED: [2017-04-05 Wed 18:42]
**** RESOLVED Large memory requirement
     CLOSED: [2017-04-06 Thu 00:50]
The current implementation keeps all the images around.
i.e. for 200 images, I had 4gb memory overhead.

Fix this so that only current image is opened.
**** DONE Arrange the images in the folder by date
     CLOSED: [2017-04-06 Thu 00:50]
*** DONE Output: create indicator for change in camera position
    CLOSED: [2017-04-06 Thu 13:24]
*** DONE Create a button to save without closing
    CLOSED: [2017-04-06 Thu 17:42]
**** DONE Don't close app on "save". 
     CLOSED: [2017-04-05 Wed 16:50]
**** DONE Prompt for a new folder
     CLOSED: [2017-04-06 Thu 17:42]
*** DONE Add scrollbar to the canvas
    Image scrollbar is on the top and left. When the image is too
    large you can't access the right and bottom side of the app.
    CLOSED: [2017-04-05 Wed 16:44]
*** ISSUE I need access to the NAS for the actual data
**** RESOLVED Copied some data but still need access
     CLOSED: [2017-03-27 Mon 16:31]
*** TODO Test modifying ROI statistics
*** ISSUE Prev_ROI Function
If image is finalized without ROI, it overwrites the previous ROI.
This is a safe way but it might be inconvenient.
